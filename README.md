**The file main.py accomplishes the following tasks:** 

1- Hosts a static website in AWS using CDKTF.

2- Routable via DNS (I do not have a custom domain that I can use, so it's using Cloudfront's default distribution domain name given by AWS).

3- It's routable via HTTPS only.

4- It only allows traffic from my IP.

5- It's creatable via CDKTF IAC.

6- The Static site is an index.html with a "Hello World".

7- It also includes the timestamp of when it was deployed as part of the html content.

**Site:** 

The site can be accessed from my computer by going to:

**Screenshots:** 

I am attaching below a screenshot of the site accessible from my IP:

And this is the result when the site is accessed via another IP that's not mine:
